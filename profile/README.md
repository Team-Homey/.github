## 💡Introduction

In recent years, conflicts within families, exacerbated by cultural differences between generations, have become a source of significant problems. In fact, according to a survey conducted in Korea, 85% of respondents believe that generational conflicts are a serious issue, and 60% of family members reported an increase in depression caused by family conflicts since COVID-19.

To alleviate these conflicts and form a harmonious family, family members need a space where they can communicate naturally, empathize with each other, and interact without feeling awkward or disconnected.

Homey can be the solution to these problems. Homey is a family communication application, and homey's biggest goal is to build a harmonious family by activating family communication.

‘Shared Gallery’ and 'Today's comment' feature provide opportunities for families to communicate and understand each other by sharing experiences, positive memories and thoughts. In addition, the activity recommendation feature provides activities that all families created based on family characteristics can enjoy, enabling active physical exchanges between them. Finally, the 'Family Relations Management Scale' feature allows you to objectively evaluate and verify family relationships and can lead to practical treatment if there is a problem.
